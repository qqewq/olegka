Overview
This file documents the original idea and structure of my algorithm for iterative goal refinement and discovery using RL and GAN, as well as its probabilistic formalization. The algorithm is designed to systematically search for combinations of subgoals that maximize the probability of achieving a revolutionary or highly improbable main goal.

Algorithm Structure (in simple terms)
Define Main Goal and Subgoal:
The process starts with a main goal (A) and its subgoal.

Form Fixed Goal:
The main goal and subgoal are combined into a fixed goal (Goal 1).

Reinforcement Learning (RL):
RL is applied to the fixed goal, with rewards that can be positive or negative.

GAN Phase:
A GAN is activated, in which the generator and discriminator are partially merged (each can generate and evaluate strategies).

Iterative Refinement:
The result of the current iteration becomes the goal for the next iteration (Goal 2). The process repeats until stable weights are achieved.

Probabilistic Formalization
Let $S = {S_1, S_2, ..., S_n}$ be the set of possible outcomes.

$P(S_i)$ is the prior probability of scenario $S_i$.

$A$ is a strategy generated by the algorithm, with probability $P(A)$.

$I(A, S_i)$ is the influence of strategy $A$ on scenario $S_i$.

The change in probability for scenario $S_i$:

Combinatorial Subgoal Search
All possible combinations of subgoals $C = {C_1, ..., C_m}$ are generated.

For each combination $K$, the RL+GAN process is run and $P(G|K)$ (probability of achieving the main goal $G$ given $K$) is estimated.

The optimal combination is:

K

Example (in plain language)
Suppose the main goal is "achieve a scientific breakthrough."
Subgoals might include "change the approach," "modify the environment," and "treat constants as variables."
The algorithm tries all combinations, runs RL+GAN for each, and calculates how much each combination increases the probability of success.
The combination with the highest probability is selected.
